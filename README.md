## Acknowledgements
I applied the **front-end development knowledge** I’ve gained from:  
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)  
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)  
- [PLP Academy](https://powerlearnproject.org/)  

I then **collaborated with AI** to generate some jokes and keep the project fun .
